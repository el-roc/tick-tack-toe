1. playerhuman1 is automatically set to x
    const playerhuman1 = X
2. playerhuman2 is automatically set to o



STEPS:
1. onclick player1 will select a box. 1/9 options to choose from to place an x, the x shows where they clicked

2. onclick player2 will select a box. 1/8 options to choose from to place an o, the o shows where they clicked

3. onclick player1 will select a box. 1/7 options to choose from to place an x, the x shows where they clicked

4. onclick player2 will select a box. 1/6 options to choose from to place an o, the o shows where they clicked

5. onclick player1 will select a box. 1/5 options to choose from to place an x, the x shows where they clicked

6. onclick player2 will select a box. 1/4 options to choose from to place an o, the o shows where they clicked

7. onclick player1 will select a box. 1/3 options to choose from to place an x, the x shows where they clicked

8. onclick player2 will select a box. 1/2 options to choose from to place an o, the o shows where they clicked

9. onclick player1 will select a box. 1/1 options to choose from to place an x, the x shows where they clicked

//Come up with code to alter players (x vs o) for the above (because someone can win without getting to all these steps)
    //Possible Code: add 1+ to the click event

//Calculate HOW TO WIN
    // 8 directions to win
      // If there is 3 of the same (x or o) in a row- win
      }else{ draw/scratch

//Calculate WHO WINS:
  //Which variable has the three in a row? x or o? ALERT ([THAT VARIABLE] WINS)

//(If reset button)- allows them to press to start game over/ clear board










10. The programs calculate what spots on the grid are left, and calculates if their is a winner(the x's, or o's are three in the row )
    -if there is a winner(human or bot), then write to the Dom `"blah" is the winner, add strike through
    -if there is no winner, continue the game.

4. then p2 (bot) will randomly place o in 1/8 options
5. this turn-taking will take place until options = 1/1 or (human or bot get three in a row or tie)
